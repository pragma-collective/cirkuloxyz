# Task

Next task we're going to work on is the auth scenario where users have an existing lens account.

A user may have 0 - many lens account. We already handled the 0 / no lens account when we redirect them to the onboarding

Now we're going to handle the scenario where a user has one or more lens profile. We need a page to redirect them
and show the available accounts, so they can choose which account to authenticate into.

It should look good if user has only one account and accounts should be properly displayed if the user has multiple

It should display the photo and username of each account in the page and a button to select that profile and authenticate as account owner
