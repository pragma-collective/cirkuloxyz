# Task

We are now going to design and build the onboarding pages. After a successful login call in, we will expect a 
flag called hasProfile. If false, We need to display an onboarding screen for the user.

The onboarding screen should have the ff: fields 

- Name
- Bio
- lens username

This submit button text should be "Mint profile"

We don't have the api connection yet so we'll just need to mock the calls and show this onboarding 
screen every time for now.
