# Task

The next flow we're going to integrate is the "No lens profile" flow that shows the onboarding page.
The onboarding page is where we're going to mint the lens profile for the user. 

Use the lens.txt file for implementation details for "Creating a user".

I've create a create-lens-account.ts hook, this is where we'll put all the code related to minting a 
lens profile
