## The Problem

Traditional banking and savings face critical challenges:

- **Banks Control Your Money** - You need permission to access, send, or save your own funds
- **Geographic Barriers** - Savings tools aren't available everywhere, exclude billions globally
- **Lack of Sovereignty** - Third parties can freeze, seize, or restrict your wealth
- **Isolated Savings** - Saving alone lacks accountability and motivation
- **No Transparency** - Hidden fees, opaque terms, and unclear savings progress
- **Technology Barriers** - Bitcoin and DeFi can feel intimidating and complex to adopt alone

## Our Solution

**Your circle, your bank.** Xersha empowers you to stack Bitcoin with friends, claim financial sovereignty, and access borderless finance—all without traditional banks.

Built on Citrea (Bitcoin's first ZK Rollup), Xersha combines the security of Bitcoin with the accountability of saving together. Take control of your wealth, save without borders, and reach your goals faster with your closest circle.
