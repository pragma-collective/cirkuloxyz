## 💡 The Problem

Traditional savings and community fundraising face critical challenges:

- **Isolated Savings** - Saving alone lacks accountability and motivation
- **Fragmented Fundraising** - Community causes scattered across multiple platforms
- **Lack of Transparency** - No clear visibility into group savings progress
- **Trust Issues** - Centralized platforms control your money
- **Limited Flexibility** - Restricted payment methods and geographic barriers
- **Technology Barriers** - New financial technology like Bitcoin can feel intimidating and complex to adopt alone

## ✨ Our Solution

**Xersha** is a Bitcoin-powered social savings platform that brings people together to achieve shared financial goals. Think of it as a social network for saving money with friends, family, and communities.

### How It Works

2. **Invite Friends** - Add members to save together and stay accountable
3. **Track Progress** - See real-time updates as your circle reaches milestones
4. **Celebrate Together** - Share achievements through a social feed experience
5. **Secure & Transparent** - Built on Bitcoin for censorship-resistant, transparent savings
